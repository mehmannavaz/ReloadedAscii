# ReloadedAscii
An engine to make ASCII looks like it's 3D!

## Usage:

## Origin of the idea
This project starts when I saw this [Invader ASCII art](https://www.asciiart.eu/video-games/other):
```
Invader
      ____   Turned invader               Normal invader
     /___/\_                                __
    _\   \/_/\__                          _|  |_
  __\       \/_/\                       _|      |_
  \   __    __ \ \                     |  _    _  |
 __\  \_\   \_\ \ \   __               | |_|  |_| |
/_/\\   __   __  \ \_/_/\           _  |  _    _  |  _
\_\/_\__\/\__\/\__\/_\_\/          |_|_|_| |__| |_|_|_|
   \_\/_/\       /_\_\/              |_|_        _|_|
      \_\/       \_\/                  |_|      |_|
```
so I said to myself... it can be an engine!
