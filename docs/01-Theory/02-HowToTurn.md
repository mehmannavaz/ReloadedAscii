# Should be large
first of all we cant do that with 3x3 art! it should be at last 6x12
like:
```
                  __________ 
 __________      /         /\  
|  __  __  |    /_________/  \ 
| |  ||  | |    \  __  __ \   \
| |__||__| |     \ \ \ \ \ \   \
|          |      \ \_\ \_\ \  / 
|__________|       \_________\/  
```

# Tured version is 1line up and more right
one line will add to the head it's stable for other example for example:
```Invader
  >>> ____ <<<<<<<<<<NEW LINE
     /___/\_                                __
    _\   \/_/\__                          _|  |_
