# the Pong Game
let's ping pong! hmt... I meant... like the pong game let's draw a dot:
```
 _
|_|
```
it's kinda odd.. but not that bad! now let's turned it:
```
to the left
 __
/_/\
\_\/
```
```
to the right
 __
/\_\
\/_/
```
awsome yea?
## what if improved?(Unicodes)
the better version of a cube can be draw like this(Box Drawing 2500–257F of UNICODES)[https://symbl.cc/en/unicode-table/#box-drawing]:
```
simple one
┌┐
└┘
bold one
┏┓
┗┛
```
kinda good ig now let's turned it to the left and right:
```
to the left
 ▁
╱ ╱╲
╲▔╲╱
 ▔
```
bad news! there no thick one for `▔` 'n `▁` and there is no bold version for `╱` 'n `╲` so we are in the dead end? no nggyu.
```
to the left(Unicodes+Ascii)
 _
╱_╱╲
╲_╲╱
```
it's kinda better but not fixed yet
